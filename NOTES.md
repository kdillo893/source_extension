### Sources of Truth (just thinking, not relevant to implementation)
How do you know a source for an article is true?

Looking at how universities and researchers affirm truth in peer review process:
1. create and send to peers
2. peer make edits and review sources and method, pass to another step
3. edits are made and verified
4. thing is published.

Something missing from the above process is a check on bias, which is why we often
see articles funded by big corporations to affirm their stances. Research and university studies are often in control of the process and method,
and they need to invent their own set of circumstances.

NEWS must follow the events that happen in physical reality and gather data which
informs the current event. For example, a crime would involve truth about what
damages are suffered, but there can be no certainties about motivation or intent
without judicial process. Another, tornados would have wind speed and rotation
around a point which is measurable and standardized for categorization.

News truths:
1. have prepared and publicized recording methods
(national weather service, police, news reporters who pass proof through
first person accounts and recording, etc),
2. refer to laws, polling, census data, or public reports for trends over time,
3. disclose things in a format as close to the gathered data as possible in 
a more digestible manner.
4. get that information to spread and inform as many relevant people as possible.

IDK what im doing :D


Could do something like the signature/PubKey stuff in encryption like GPG/PGP,
which would require central auth or trust chains from each other.

Was thinking of something like how we sign certs and keys.
